# Predicting Diabetes - Binary Classification

## Overview
This project builds a binary classification model to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes.  
It uses a dataset containing health-related attributes such as:
- Glucose level
- BMI
- Age
- Insulin level
- Blood pressure

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature scaling
- Neural network design for binary output
- Model training and evaluation
